## My process

The first thing I did was to write the HTML structure then proceeded to write the styles while referring to the style guide provided by front-end mentor. After that I wrote the Javascript for the generate button. Researching how the advice api works helped me implement it to my project.

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Desktop-first workflow
- Javascipt Advice API

### What I learned

The most valuable lesson I learned while doing this project was how to implement Javascript APIs.
